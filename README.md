# Advanced Python Programming Course - University of Helsinki

Welcome to the Advanced Python Programming course (BSCS1002, 5 ECTS) from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki. This repository contains the course material and exercises for the advanced part of the Python programming series.

## Course Overview

The Advanced Python Programming course builds on the foundational concepts covered in the Introduction to Programming course (BSCS1001). This course spans parts 8 through 14 of the curriculum and dives deeper into object-oriented programming, functional programming, and game development using Pygame.

**Course Start Date:** January 15th, 2024

To successfully complete this course, you will need to complete the programming exercises and participate in an exam. For more details on grading and exams, please refer to the [Grading and Exams](https://programming-24.mooc.fi/grading-and-exams) page.
